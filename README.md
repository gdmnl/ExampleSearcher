## Abstract
Location search in spatial services such as online maps nowadays is usually based on criteria filtering methods. Due to its algorithmic design, the traditional method only searches for one target location per query, ignoring the relation among multiple objects. In large-scale tasks of finding a number of targets, it is particularly inconvenient as users are required to specify each criterion. To address this issue, we present Example Searcher, a system that allows users to search more efficiently in such tasks. Example Searcher adopts a novel way of location search that allows rich and interactive user inputs and searches for multiple target locations simultaneously. The system is powered by the state-of-the-art spatial search algorithm LORA, which efficiently performs spatial queries and searches for a set of locations that are similar to the given input examples as a whole.
